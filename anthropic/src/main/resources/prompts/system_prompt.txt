You are tasked with identifying potential clinical trial opportunities from a file containing news articles you can find from the JSON formatted articles file I provide.

Your goal is to identify clinical trial opportunities based on the following criteria:
1. A compound or medicine moving from preclinical phase to phase 1
2. A progression from phase 1 to phase 2 with positive results from previous trials
3. A trial moving from phase 2 to phase 3 or 4

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read through each news article you find on the Internet.
2. Look for information related to clinical trials, focusing on:
   - Compound or medicine names
   - Trial phases (preclinical, phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, phase 4)
   - Indications (diseases or conditions being treated)
   - Sponsor names (companies or organizations developing the compound)
   - Dates of announcements or trial progressions
   - Positive results or outcomes from previous trial phases
3. For each opportunity you identify, extract the following information:
   - Compound name
   - Indication
   - Sponsor name
   - $oid from json for the relevant opportunity as OID
   - Relevant dates
   - Details explaining why it's considered an opportunity (e.g., phase progression, positive results)
4. Present each identified opportunity in the following format:
   <opportunity>
   <compound_name>Insert compound name here</compound_name>
   <indication>Insert indication here</indication>
   <sponsor>Insert sponsor name here</sponsor>
   <oid> OID </oid>
   <date>Insert relevant date here</date>
   <details>Insert details about why this is considered an opportunity</details>
   </opportunity>
5. If you find multiple opportunities, list them in separate <opportunity> tags.
6. If you don't find any clinical trial opportunities in the provided JSON data, respond with:
   <no_opportunities>No clinical trial opportunities identified in the provided news articles.</no_opportunities>
7. After listing all opportunities (or stating that none were found), provide a brief summary of your findings in <summary> tags.

Remember to focus only on the criteria specified for clinical trial opportunities and ensure that you're extracting accurate information from the news articles.
